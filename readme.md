### Here we go again...

I thought that the original was in desperate need of a refresh, so here we are doing this yet-again.

Just a note, this is still a major WIP. I'm just pushing the first iteration out before I head out of the office today (9/23/22).

I was thinking we'd do this version w/Bootstrap 5.2 using group-item-lists and some other CSS-tricks.
